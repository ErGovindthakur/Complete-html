            Content writing for the education industry, social media, blog posts, and/or any advertising vehicle that targets education-seekers takes a very special approach. In a lot of cases, content is sourced from school course catalogs and is written academically. While the program descriptions are often accurate and describe the details, it doesn’t function well as a piece of marketing collateral. What is worse is that boring content equals less engagement and performs badly in search engines

The Young and talented right-handed batsman, Virat Kohli was born on the 5th of November in 1988 in Delhi. His father was Prem Kohli and his mother Saroj Kohli. His father worked as a lawyer and he passed away in December 19th, 2006 due to brain stroke. Virat has an elder brother, Vikash and an elder sister, Bhavna.

On that day only (19th December 2006), at 3 o’clock in the morning, his dad passed away due to brain stroke.
<br><br>
